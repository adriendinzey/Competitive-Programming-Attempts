### Notes
I kept working on B after the contest because knew my method wasn't perfect 
but I was pretty sure it would work and I ended up refining it pretty well
and it was accepted about 30 mins after the end of the contest.

I took so long doing b because I confused myself thinking out the cases.
I also avoided the simpler thing of sorting the ranges because I didn't want the running time to be too long
But then I ended up with a complexity of O(N^2) anyways ðŸ˜‚
