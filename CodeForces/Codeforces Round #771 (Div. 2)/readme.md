### Notes
Definitely dropped the ball on this one. I feel like I was extremely close to getting at least 3/6 but both of my solutions that weren't accepting were either too inefficient or forgetting some edge case somewhere. I found I just didn't have the energy to properly debug the code and my productivity sufferred (these tournaments being hosted from 4am-8am my local time really make it difficult to perform well). Minor step back in my progress, the next one I'll surely do better, can't get much worse than 1/6 problems solved.
