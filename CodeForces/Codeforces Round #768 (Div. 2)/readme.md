### Notes
I'm really getting back into the grove of competitive programming and I'm starting to get consistently where I think is a reasonable amount of questions answered. I managed to finish 3 solutions with about 7 minutes left to start on a fourth problem. I hope that 3 questions answered will be my minimum from now on as I hope to break through the next ceiling and try to get 4 solved problems consistently
