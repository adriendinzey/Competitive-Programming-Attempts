### Notes
This one went a lot more as expected! Ended up with a lot of extra time (like 40 minutes) to solve d,e and f. Was attempting some of them but couldn't even conceptually grasp them and again was feeling too tired to really get into the nitty gritty of them. These early contests are a problem but since I'm just doing these for practice right now (Especially because ICPC regionals are on Saturday) I was okay with just doing what I could. Lots of other assignments and internship interviews going on this week so I'd allocate energy into that!
